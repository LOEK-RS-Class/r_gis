# if-else

Sometimes you want code that executes only in certain conditions. This is done via `if-else` structures like the example below. The `condition` in the if-statement expects `TRUE` or `FALSE` so, the use of logical operators is again necessary.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

if(condition){
  # Command 1
  
} else{
  # Command 2
  
}

```
