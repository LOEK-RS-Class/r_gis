# Raster Exercise 01


::: {.callout-important}
## Task 1: Raster Input

* Load the SRTM and land cover tiles into R.
* Create one combined SRTM layer and one combines land cover layer out of the tiles.

## Task 2: Simple querries

* How often does each land cover class occur in this area?
* What is the lowest and highest elevation in this area?
:::



```{r echo = FALSE}
#| label: fig-raster-merge
#| fig-cap: "Raster with different spatial properties"
knitr::include_graphics("assets/raster-merge-problems.png")
```


::: {.callout-note}
## Task 3: Think first!

* Which steps are needed (conceptually), such that the SRTM and land cover raster fit exactly on top of each other?
:::


::: {.callout-important}
## Task 4: Multi-layer raster 

* Create a multi-layer raster from the SRTM and land cover raster.
* Give both layers an appropriate name.
* Plot the raster.
* Save the raster as a ".grd" file.
:::

## Task 5: Advanced raster querries

* On average, are forests or agricultural areas found at higher elevations?
* Divide the terrain model into "slopes" and "flats".
* In flat areas, which land cover class is the most common?
* Find and visualize all forests at southern slopes.
