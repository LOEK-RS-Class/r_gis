## Task 1: OSM Data

* download OpenStreetMap as shapefile data for Muenster here: [https://download.geofabrik.de/](https://download.geofabrik.de/)
* load the points of interest (POIs), land use and streets into R
* plot the data with the `mapview` package

## Task 2: Thematic querries

1. How many bakeries are there in Muenster?
2. How many hotels and hostels are there in Muenster?
3. Where is the A1?
4. How many "recreation_ground" are Freib채der? (i.e. have "Freibad" or "freibad" in their name)

## Task 3: Topological / Spatial querries

* How many benches are in forests?
* Which forests are within 25km distance to the A1?
  * Tipp: `st_is_within_distance()`
  * What could be a different solution to this problem?
* How many bakeries are within 1km from the Geo1 building?

## Task 4: Distances, Lengths, Areas

Test the functions `st_area()`, `st_length()` and `st_distance()` in the following examples:

* How large are the forests in the M체nsterland on average?
* How long is the A1 in the M체nsterland?
* How far away are bakeries in the M체nsterland on average from the next bakery? What is the standard deviation?
