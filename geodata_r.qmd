# Geodata in R

We will use two main packages in this course for working with geodata. `sf` (simple features) is used for vector data and `terra` will handle raster data.

Both packages are relatively new and are successors:
 * `sf` replaces the deprecated package `sp`.
 * `terra` replaces the deprecated package `raster`.

You will probably find a lot of code examples online (e.g. on Stack Overflow) that uses these old packages.
**DO NOT USE the `sp` OR the `raster` PACKAGES ANYMORE!**

## Task: Geodata I/O

* Organize yourself some geodata.
* Install the `terra` and `sf` packages.
* Try to load a raster and a vector dataset into R.

* What attributes does the geodata have?
* Visualize the data.
