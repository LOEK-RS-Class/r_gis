```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, include = TRUE)
```



```{r, fig.cap = "The chimera of R and GIS", echo = FALSE}

```

## Target audience

- you are fluent in the basic R syntax
- it is beneficial (but not required) if you have worked with spatial data before
- you want to incorporate spatial data into your R workflow


## Why R as GIS?

- open source
- flexible (statistical) analysis
- flexible visualizations
- easy automization of processes and workflows
- complete reproducibility
- ONE platform for data acquisition, (spatial) processing, (spatial) statistical analysis, visualization



## Aims of this course

-   get to know R packages for spatial data analysis
-   handling raster and vector data in R
-   using R as a "meta language" to control dedicated GIS software
-   developing workflows in R that involve spatial data
