Before we combine R and SAGA, let's first have a look at a SAGA module separately to get a feel for what we can do with it.

:::{.callout-important}
## Task: SAGA GIS I
* Import a terrain model into SAGA.
  * Import/Export
  * GDAL
  * Import Raster

* Preprocess the terrain model for the hydrological analysis with the `Fill Sinks` tool.

## Task: SAGA GIS II
* Delinate catchment areas from the preprocessed terrain model with the tool `Channel network and Drainage Basins`.
* Also calculate the flow accumulation.
